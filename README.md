# Logic Gate Simulator

## Overview
This program creates a network of logic gate objects in Java (AND, OR, NOT, CONST â€“ NOT/CONST gates having one input and output pin, and AND/OR gates having two input pins and one output pin) based on input, and will simulate their behavior (even simulating random electrical-current fluctuations, gate-thresholds, and wire/gate delays) and output when connected with wire objects using a lambda-expression-based event scheduling system in any valid circuit.

## Running the Program
In order to run the program, you will compile the Logic.java file, and then run it with one argument that is the file containing the circuit you would like to simulate.

### How to Make a Circuit File
There are two objects that the argument file (.txt) will need to simulate a circuit: a ```Gate``` and a ```Wire```. The four types of ```Gate```s are: ```And```, ```Or```, ```Not```, and ```Const```. ```And``` gates output ```True``` when both inputs to it are ```True``` and ```False``` otherwise, ```Or``` gates output ```True``` when one or both inputs to it are ```True``` and ```False``` otherwise, ```Not``` gates output ```False``` when their input is ```True``` and ```True``` when their input is ```False```, ```Const``` gates only output ```True``` and do not have any inputs. ```Wires``` connect the output of one gate to the input of another (the other can be itself). Use the following format to construct ```Wire```s and ```Gate```s, where each new ```Wire``` or ```Gate``` declaration is on a new line:
  * ```gate <and,or,not,const> <name> <delay>``` creates an ```And```,```Or```,```Not``` or ```Const``` gate (replace ```<and,or>``` with either ```and```,```or```,```not```, or ```const```) where ```<name>``` should be a string denoting name for the gate and ```<delay>``` is a floating point number denoting the time it takes for a signal to travel from the input and reach its output pin.
  * ```wire <source_gate> <source_gate_pin> <destination_gate> <destination_gate_pin>``` creates a wire from ```<source_gate>``` where ```<source_gate>``` is the name of the gate from which the signal will go and ```<source_gate_pin>``` is the name of the pin (either ```in1```,```in2``` (if the source gate can have two inputs), or ```out```) the wire will connect to (keep in mind a valid circuit is one in which a wire connects the output of one gate to the input of another). ```<destination_gate>``` is the name of the gate to which the signal will go and ```destination_gate_pin``` is the name of the pin (either ```in1```,```in2``` (if the source gate can have two inputs), or ```out```) that the wire will carry the signal to (again, keep in mind a valid circuit is one in which a wire connects the output of one gate to the input of another).
